One of the greatest resources that PICA has available, as a result of the partnership with Snow Leopard Trust, is access to their long-term snow leopard camera trapping image database carried out across numerous Central Asian countries. With snow leopard and Pallas\u2019s cat sharing much of the same habitat and range, these images can be a quick and valuable resource to identify Pallas\u2019s cat presence, activity patterns and association with other species. In some ways the work being done to protect and monitor snow leopards is therefore improving our understanding of the Pallas\u2019s cat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><mark style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#a0d789\" class=\"has-inline-color\">CAMERA TRAPPING LURE RESEARCH<\/mark><\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Previous research carried out by PICA staff at RZSS Highland Wildlife Park studied and analysed captive Pallas\u2019s cat vocalisations through the breeding season with the aim of using the data to help adapt breeding management techniques. Using these vocalisations as auditory \u201clures\u201d PICA staff have supported two MSC students who conducted captive trails testing them against others (olfactory) lures including catnip, valerian oil. These trails were undertaken as a precursor for field testing in a Pallas\u2019s cat range country where their presence was known. In 2018 the PICA team joined forces with the Snow Leopard Trust field team in Kyrgyzstan to test these lures alongside a camera trapping survey to explore the possibility of improving the capture success of Pallas\u2019s cats and other small carnivores. As a small secretive and elusive cat, it is no surprise that Pallas\u2019s cats have a low detection rate during field surveys whether the monitoring technique is camera trapping, snow tracking or visual observations. Field research techniques that could improve capture rate could be a valuable tool for future monitoring surveys.
